#+TITLE: ChirpyTS

This is the typescript version of Chirpy.

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To properly run Chirpy you will need a postgres database. I personally recommend
just using a docker image, in which case you can run the following:
#+begin_src shell
  make startdb
#+end_src

You will also need to create the chirpy database:
#+begin_src shell
  make initdb
#+end_src

I also use [[https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm][drizzle]] to apply the sql files to the postgres database, which you
can apply with the following:
#+begin_src shell
  make migrate
#+end_src

To run Chirpy you will need to do the following:
#+begin_src shell
  npm run dev
#+end_src
